# undergrad_astro_research
My undergraduate astronomy research work at Wesleyan University, where I studied the accretion histories of AGN. Under `scripts`, you will find the Python scripts that I created and worked on, which use data from the Einstein, ROSAT, and Chandra X-ray Observatories. My thesis that was a result of this work can be found under `thesis\thesis.pdf`.
